					<p>
						Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a full-stack developer who loves turning coffee
						into code and building stuff that makes life a little smoother. When
						I'm not wrestling with production bugs, you'll find me tinkering
						with my homelab - my personal playground where I experiment with Docker
						containers, automate everything that moves, and host family-friendly
						alternatives to big tech services.
					</p>
					<p>
						Between ThinkCentre clusters and reverse proxy configs, I squeeze in
						time for tech reads and the occasional gaming marathon. Always up
						for chatting about self-hosted solutions and modern development practices!
